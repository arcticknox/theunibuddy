## Introduction/Idea Description:
Attending a foriegn university can get challenging for new international students. The most common challenges include but are not limited to:
1. Things to pack
2. Arrival formalities
3. Looking for accomodation/housing
5. Meeting people with similar interests
6. Navigating through University and nearby spaces
7. Banking options
6. Etc.

We are developing ***UniBuddy*** which would serve as a one stop solution of necessary resources for prospective students. These resources will not help students with onboarding but will also help in making them comfortable until they become completely independent.

## Introduction/Idea Description:

Attending a foriegn university can get challenging for new international students. The most common challenges include but are not limited to:

1. Things to pack
2. Arrival formalities
3. Looking for accomodation/housing
4. Meeting people with similar interests
5. Navigating through University and nearby spaces
6. Banking options
7. Etc.

We are developing **_UniBuddy_** which would serve as a one stop solution of necessary resources for prospective students. These resources will not only help students with onboarding but will also help in making them comfortable until they become completely independent.
